#Question 1
Implement an algorithm to delete a node in the middle of a singly linked list given access only to that node. 

Example:
Input: the node c from the linked list a -> b -> c -> d -> e
Result: nothing is returned but new linked list is 	a -> b -> d -> e
						A -> b -> d -> e -> e 

Hint: Picture the list 1 -> 5 -> 9 -> 12. Removing 9 would make it look like 1 -> 5 -> 12. You only have access to the 9 node. Can you make it look like the correct answer?
