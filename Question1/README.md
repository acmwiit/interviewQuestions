#Question 2
For the following scenario, you are given a data set from USDA (US Department of Agriculture)
http://www.plants.usda.gov/dl_all.html
The headers are: 
Symbol, Synonym Symbol, Scientific Name with Authors, National  Common Name & Family.  These fields are delimited by commas and enclosed in double quotes.  The file is 7MB.  

	
You have a large data set you need to have available for your department.  The botanists need a way to find the information about plants in an efficient matter.  They also need to be able to make updates to the data set - such as changing the Scientific Names because new research indicates that the name given is not correct OR they found a new plant species and need to insert an entire line of data OR they found that the plant listed is incorrect and needs to be deleted from the database.  
Your Job is to answer the following questions: 
What data structure would you use to implement this?  Is using a Hash Table or Hash Map the correct way to answer this question?  
If you did use a Hash Table or Hash Map, how would you solve for multiple values for any given key(s)?
